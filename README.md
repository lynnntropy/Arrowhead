A small, text based game. Currently Linux-only because of its heavy dependency on the ncurses library (It's also the project I'm using to teach myself ncurses).

EDIT: It now runs on Windows as well. If you have MinGW and the PDCurses library installed properly, just use make.bat to compile it.

You are the pilot of a small ship - the size of a single ASCII character. Currently all you can do it fly around the space inside the terminal (no matter how big the terminal window is).
Eventually, you will be able to pick up powerups, and possibly destroy objects and maybe even enemies.
